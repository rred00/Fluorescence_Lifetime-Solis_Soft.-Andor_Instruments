# üß™ Experimental Details: FLIM & TRPL on Rhodamine 6G

This experiment demonstrates the use of a **dual-mode setup** for both widefield **Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIM)** and **Time-Resolved Photoluminescence (TRPL)** spectroscopy.  
The goal was
  to obtain a fluorescene lifetime image
  to correlate **spectral-temporal dynamics** with **spatial lifetime maps** from the same sample, without modifying the external optics.

## üìå Sample Preparation
- **Sample**: Rhodamine 6G (3 mM in methanol).  
- The solution was placed in a standard cuvette for optical measurements.  

---

## üî¶ Excitation Source
- **Laser**: Ti:Sapphire femtosecond laser (Coherent Libra).  
- **Pulse width**: ~100 fs  
- **Wavelength**: 808 nm (frequency-doubled for excitation).  
- **Repetition rate**: 1 kHz  
- **Excitation pulses**: SHG pulses were directed onto the sample.

## üé• Detection System
- **Detector**: Intensified CCD (iCCD) camera Ador iSTAR series 
- **Spectrometer**: Andor Kymera 328i (coupled to iCCD).  
- Both TRPL and FLIM modes share the same detection hardware.

## üî¨ TRPL Measurements
- The **emission spectrum** was recorded by the spectrometer‚ÄìiCCD system.  
- **Temporal mapping** was achieved with:
  - Gate width: **2 ns**  
  - Delay steps: **1 ns**  
- Results:
  - Peak emission observed at **567 nm**.  
  - Fluorescence decay fitted with a **bi-exponential model**:
    - Dominant component: **‚âà2.10 ns**  
    - Minor, longer component: **‚âà18.0 ns**

## üñºÔ∏è FLIM Measurements
After TRPL, the system was switched into FLIM mode **without changing the optics or sample conditions**:  
- **Spectrometer passivated** (bypassed).  
- A **bandpass filter (540 ¬± 20 nm)** inserted to select emission region of interest.  
- Time-gated images were collected using the same iCCD configuration.  
- Lifetime analysis was performed **pixel-wise** with:
  - Single-exponential fitting  
  - Deconvolution with the **Instrument Response Function (IRF)**  

Result:  
- Average fluorescence lifetime across the image: **‚âà2.30 ns**

## ‚ö° Key Takeaway
This **dual-mode TRPL‚ÄìFLIM setup** provides a **flexible and efficient approach** to study both the spectral-temporal response and the spatial lifetime distribution of fluorescent samples.  

By switching seamlessly between TRPL and FLIM, we can correlate **decay kinetics** with **lifetime maps**, offering deeper insight into the excited-state dynamics of Rhodamine 6G.
