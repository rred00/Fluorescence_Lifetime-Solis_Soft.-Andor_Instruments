# Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging (FLIM) Plotting Toolkit

This repository contains Python scripts for plotting **Time-Resolved Photoluminescence (TRPL)** and **Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM)** data.  
It is designed to help researchers visualize experimental lifetime data using simple, customizable plots.
