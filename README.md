# Fluorescence lifetime image (FLIM) Plotting Toolkit
# This will work only for the generated ASCII file from ANDOR Instruments U.K.
This repository contains Python scripts for plotting **Time-Resolved Photoluminescence (TRPL)** and **Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy (FLIM)** data.  
It is designed to help researchers visualize experimental lifetime data using simple, customizable plots.

## Features
- Plot TRPL decay curves from experimental data.
- Visualize FLIM lifetime maps with colormaps.
- Adjustable fitting options (single/multi-exponential).
- Easy to modify and extend for specific experimental setups.
