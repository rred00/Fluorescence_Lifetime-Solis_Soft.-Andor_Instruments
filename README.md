# Fluorescence_Lifetime-Solis_Soft.-Andor_Instruments
. FLIM measures the time a fluorophore remains in its excited state before emitting a photon, making it highly sensitive to the local environment such as pH, ion concentration, or molecular interactions. This repository contains Python tools for processing and visualizing FLIM data, including lifetime extraction and colormap-based imaging
